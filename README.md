<h1>Overview</h1>
Wordle is a highly popular word game worldwide. I have developed the mobile version of the game, which can be played offline. Currently, the game is only available in Turkish, but I plan to integrate it into other languages over time.
<h1>Rules</h1> 
* Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. <br>
* The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word. <br>
* The green color indicates that the letter is in the word and in the correct position. <br>
* The yellow color indicates that the letter is in the word, but in the wrong position. <br>
* The gray color indicates that the letter is not in the word. <br>
* You have 6 guesses. <br>
* Good luck.ðŸ˜Š
